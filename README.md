# kokoScripts
kokoScripts is a repository full of scripts I use for all kind of things. They mainly automate boring office-jobs but I also like making them do fun stuff.

Don't expect any production code, documentation or pull-requests to be accepted (even though I may add workflows in the future).

JUST USE THEM AND DON'T ASK MANY QUESTIONS
